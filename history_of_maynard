Did you know that this town hosted the first thinktank in the US?
1924, The ThinkTank needed a base of operation.  They selected this town due to the sweeping vistas.

The ThinkTank's members wanted to meet in July, however the town council had too many events scheduled in that month, so they had to pick a new time.

This is why the town is called Maynard, rather than Julynard.
