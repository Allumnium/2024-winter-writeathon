My mother left us when I was very young. I was too young.

Too young to understand why she left, and too malnourished to follow. At the time, my baby brother Glenn lay weakly, cushioned by tall grass and with a thin blanket of fallen leaves obscuring a little tuft of hair on his head. Despite my hunger, I was happy then. If just for a moment.

WALTERNOTE: I already want revenge

It's odd how memories work. The thing I remember most about that morning, besides Mother leaving, was the way the sunlight pierced through a singular drop of dew right in front of my nose. It was so close I had to turn my head a little bit to see it, but that single drop of water shone as bright as the sun itself. It hung precariously on the tip of the blade, as if it could fall any moment.

Mother came over and gently nuzzled us before heading out to find breakfast. I could tell by the way she paced back and forth that she was as hungry as we were and eager for dawn to break to begin a search for sustenance. When she finally came over, her warm breath ran over my face and I pretended to be fully asleep. Or, at least that was my intent. Pretending to sleep is a dangerous game, as I woke up a few hours later on that same patch of grass. Normally, Mother would return within an hour and take us with her to some wild berries or hidden cache of flowers.

I let out a grunt and got up unceremoniously, stretching out my legs in all directions. Glenn was sitting quietly besides a tree a short distance away but I could faintly hear him weeping.

WALTERNOTE: Stretched leges in all direction... AH I'M A DEER!!!

"Where is Mother?", I asked Glenn. He just wept harder, increasing in both pitch and volume. I sat down adjacent and waited for him to relax, my own anxious tension rising inversely. After a few minutes, I couldn't take it anymore. I was about to shout at him when I felt it.

It began faintly, like the forest around us was vibrating. An even more subtle call rang out in the distance, a call like I've never heard before like a caucophony of birds all at once. Then, I could distinctly feel it in my hooves, giving them a slight tingle like a slight tickle.

Birds above us evacuated to the air with a panicked squawk and my brother's eyes formed into puddles of pure despair. "I'm scared", he whined.

I got up and followed the scent trail of Mother, running as fast as my wobbly legs could take me. As I ran, the rumbling grew and grew and Mother's scent grew with it. After a quick tangle with some bushes, the world grabbed me by the tail and spun me over my head and I fell into a clearing.

The entire duration that I sat there, fallen on the ground, looking at the world sideways, I had no conception of time or scale. It was as if my existence had ceased and the only beings in this world were myself and the beast that was before me. Was it a beast? Or was it the world itself? I can only describe it as a blurred wall of unending motion, scarring the ground it moved upon. I was wholely stunned, completely petrified unable to even turn my head to orient myself and view it in its full might.

It couldn't have been a creature, because no conceiveable being could move that fast and be so large that time itself cannot contain its proportion. It was an endless stream of washed-out edges and angles, offering no compliance with any attempt to identify or name it. An unnameable monstrous visage, that literally shook my core to the bone as I lay on the wet grass in front of it.

I don't know how much time passed while I lay there. I could not even hope to attempt to understand what I saw, let alone fully perceive it in the sheer magnitude of volume and vibration of its magnificent form. Then it let out the same splitting howl as I heard earlier but this time my heart nearly stopped despite its otherwise enthusiastic efforts to set a record for most beats per minute. My ears never worked the same after hearing it howl. The rest of the world is dulled by comparison now, or maybe it was simply too much for them to take in. The important thing, is that soon after it unleashed that howl, it disappeared - almost as quickly as it had appeared.

And there was Mother. On the other side of the scab of earth left behind by the beast. It split the forest like a scar, where fur never grows again. But there was Mother on the other side, maybe as stunned and overwhelmed as I was because she was completely still on the ground next similar to how I was after I had tripped a moment ago. I eagerly ran over and lept over the scarred earth, just relieved to see Mother again.

I wasn't disillusioned, even then, that she might've been alive. I had realized it as soon as I had lept over the tracks. A pool of her warm blood stained my hooves.
