> Train track train


> How is the rail perceived?
The forest has a scar, scabbed across the forest
A trail left by a massive beast

> What effects does the beast induce?
Blinding light
Stunned
Horror
Rumble
Unimaginable size
Roar itself shakes the earth
Gale that follows rips the leaves off the trees

> What is on the other side of the track?
Utopia
Heaven
Meadows and fields of flowers, massive lakes

> What unique sensory experiences does the perspective offer?


> What is the history with the beast?
Herd matriarch left when I


My mother left us when I was very young. I was too young.

Too young to understand why she left, and too malnourished to follow. At the time, my baby brother Glenn lay weakly, cushioned by tall grass and with a thin blanket of fallen leaves obscuring a little tuft of hair on his head. Despite my hunger, I was happy then. If just for a moment.

It's odd how memories work. The thing I remember most about that morning, besides Mother leaving, was the way the sunlight pierced through a singular drop of dew right in front of my nose. It was so close I had to turn my head a little bit to see it, but that single drop of water shone as bright as the sun itself. It hung precariously on the tip of the blade, as if it could fall any moment.

Mother came over and gently nuzzled us before heading out to find breakfast. I could tell by the way she paced back and forth that she was as hungry as we were and eager for dawn to break to begin a search for sustenance.

When she came over, her warm breath ran over my face and I pretended to be fully asleep. Or, at least that was my intent. Pretending to sleep is a dangerous game, as I woke up a few hours later on that same patch of grass. Normally, Mother would return within an hour and take us with her to some wild berries or hidden cache of flowers.

I let out a grunt and got up unceremoniously, stretching out my legs in all directions. Glenn was sitting quietly besides a tree a short distance away but I could faintly hear him weeping.
